## Summary

This documentation lists all tests related to users management: creation,
update, fetch, delete, etc.

All test cases are described here. Each one has a unique identifier starting
with `TC/`. The full identifier must be declared as comments in test files so
that a matching is possible by a script to generate a coverage matrix.
